==============
v1.1.0 Release
==============

What's New
----------

* Views of block and tiled tensors has been made easier.
* :cpp:class:`TensorView`s can be made from :cpp:class:`RuntimeTensor`s and :cpp:class:`RuntimeTensorView`s
  so that compile-time rank can be assigned to them.
* Buffer allocators for future projects. These allow users to limit the amount of memory used by Einsums.
* Tensor permutations where the smallest stride is not 1.
* The in-core generic algorithm is now much more performant.
* The dispatching function for :cpp:func:`einsum` is now more modular, so it is hopefully easier to maintain.

What's Removed
--------------

* `sort` is no longer a valid alias for :cpp:func:`permute`.
