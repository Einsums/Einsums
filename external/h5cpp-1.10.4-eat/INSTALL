This distribution contains two packages: an c++17 template library for major linear algebra packages and a source code transformation tool that help you to generate HDF5 compound datatype descriptors from valid C/C++ include files. 

1. download and install HDF5 v1.10.4 from https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/
from the source tree execute.:
```
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-build-mode=production --enable-shared --enable-static --enable-optimization=high --with-default-api-version=v110
make -j4
sudo make install
```
NOTE: the system is often shipped with existing hdf5 installation, the supplied CMAKE will be looking in `/usr/local` first. 

2. install libh5cpp-dev:
	a. copy and ship the content of h5cpp/* with your distribution
    b. `sudo make install`
	c. ./configure && make install

3. linear algebra packages better to install from sources, for performance consider using Intel MKL BLAS/LAPACK
   nevertheless here are few packages generally available on the system. For new project I recommend Armadillo C++ or Eigen3	 
	`sudo apt-get install -y libarmadillo-dev libitpp-dev libblitz0-dev  libeigen3-dev libdlib-dev`


For development on Ubuntu 18.04 based systems:
----------------
```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential fakeroot devscripts google-perftools kcachegrind doxygen doxygen-gui markdown libboost-program-options-dev libgtest-dev cmake gcc g++
sudo apt-get install -y libarmadillo-dev libitpp-dev libblitz0-dev  libeigen3-dev libdlib-dev
```

You have to do some manual labor here:
```
cd /usr/src/gtest && sudo cmake ./ && sudo make install
```

To package the library check out the relevant branch, ie: debian, then run `make dist-deb`
which in turn will run the cmake based configuration scripts, generates new make file and finally the
installation package.


On AWS EC2 with ubuntu 18.04
-----------
1. start an image us-east-1: ami-046842448f9e74e7d
2. connect to running instance with ssh

HDF5
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential g++ gcc cmake
cd ~/ && wget http://h5cpp.org/download/hdf5-1.10.6.tar.gz
tar -xvzf hdf5-1.10.6.tar.gz && cd hdf5-1.10.6/
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-build-mode=production
make -j4 && sudo make install
```
compiler:
```
cd ~/ && wget http://h5cpp.org/download/h5cpp_1.10.4-5_amd64.deb
sudo apt install libllvm6.0 libclang-common-6.0-dev
sudo dpkg -i h5cpp_1.10.4-5_amd64.deb
```

header only:
```
cd ~/ && wget http://h5cpp.org/download/h5cpp-dev_1.10.4-5_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i h5cpp-dev_1.10.4-5_amd64.deb
```

cleanup: `cd ~/ && rm -rf h5cpp* hdf5*`

running examples:
```
cp -R /usr/share/h5cpp/ ./ && cd h5cpp/examples
```

Running examples:
```
sudo apt install libarmadillo-dev
cd ~/ && cp -R /usr/share/h5cpp/ ./  && cd h5cpp/examples
```
I am checking the examples as of now, and will get back to you if everything checks
