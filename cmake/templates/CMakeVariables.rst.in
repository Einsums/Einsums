|cmake| options
===============

When configuring |einsums|, you can set a variety of options to allow CMake to
generate your specific makefiles/project files. A list of the most important
|cmake| options can be found in :ref:`important_cmake_options`, while this section
includes the comprehensive list.

.. _configure:

Variables that influence how |einsums| is built
-------------------------------------------

The options are split into these categories:

@EINSUMS_CMAKE_OPTIONS_RST@

.. _cmake_additional_tools:

Additional tools and libraries used by |einsums|
--------------------------------------------

Here is a list of additional libraries and tools that are either optionally
supported by the build system or are optionally required for certain examples or
tests. These libraries and tools can be detected by the |einsums| build system.

Each of the tools or libraries listed here will be automatically detected if
they are installed in some standard location. If a tool or library is installed
in a different location, you can specify its base directory by appending
``_ROOT`` to the variable name as listed below. For instance, to configure a
custom directory for ``Amplifier``, specify ``Amplifier_ROOT=/custom/amplifier/root``.

.. option:: Amplifier_ROOT:PATH

   Specifies where to look for one of the tools of the Intel Parallel Studio
   product, either Intel Amplifier or Intel Inspector. This should be
   set if the CMake variable ``EINSUMS_USE_ITT_NOTIFY`` is set to ``ON``. Enabling
   ITT support in |einsums| will integrate any application with the mentioned Intel
   tools, which customizes the generated information for your application and
   improves the generated diagnostics.
