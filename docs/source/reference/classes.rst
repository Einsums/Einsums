Classes/Structs
***************

In this chapter Doxygen docstrings are presented for classes/structs.
Many docstrings contain example code, which demonstrates basic usage of
the class/struct. The examples assume that Einsums has been incldued with::

    #include <einsums.hpp>

It is also assumed, in many examples, that the following `using namespace` command has been used::

    using namespace einsums;

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    class.tensor
