# Sphinx Domain for Modern CMake

This is taken directly from the Kitware git repository's Utilities directory.
The original [sphinxcontrib-cmakedomain][] has not been touched in quite some and
as a result it was wildly out of date. Documenting CMake domain entities in
projects is painful otherwise. This works *exactly* in the same way as Kitware,
so some time might be needed to study their approach to these problems.

This repository is under the same License as all of CMake, which is the
BSD-3-Clause license.

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
Any issues you run into with this plugin must be reported to [Kitware][],
unless they involve the packaging itself. The Python files exactly match
the CMake source for the released version numbers.

# Installation

## PyPI

This domain is available via PyPI. Install it directly via `pip`:

```
$ pip install sphinxcontrib-moderncmakedomain
```

Alternatively, place it inside of your `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`,
`requirements.txt` or whatever system it is that you use to declare and manage
your dependencies. A new version will usually only be released if there is a
change to this extension inside CMake.

## Git

This module is installable via `pip` and GitHub directly as well

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/scikit-build/moderncmakedomain.git
```

# Usage

To enable the use of the `moderncmakedomain`, add
`sphinxcontrib.moderncmakedomain` to the `extensions` variable of your
`conf.py` file:

```python
extensions = [..., 'sphinxcontrib.moderncmakedomain', ...]
```

The plugin currently provides several directives and references. These are
documented below.

## Directives

|     directive      | description                                         |
|:------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------|
| `cmake:variable::` | For a basic variable                                |
| `cmake:command::`  | For a function                                      |
|  `cmake-module::`  | Autodoc style extractor (takes a relative filepath) |
|  `cmake:envvar::`  | For environment variables                           |

To declare any of the references found below, they must be placed into a
directory with the same name under the sphinx SOURCEDIR/master doc. Thus,
`prop_tgt/MY_PERSONAL_PROPERTY.rst` can be referred to with
``:prop_tgt:`MY_PERSONAL_PROPERTY` ``. This is currently the *only* way CMake
permits declaring new properties.

## References

Each reference below can be placed into a directory with the same name to
document custom extensions provided by your CMake libraries.

|      ref       | description                                        |

# History

`sphinx-moderncmakedomain` was initially developed in October 2018 by
[slurps-mad-rips][slurps-mad-rips] to help write CMake documentation by simply
publishing a python package of the same. This was a critical step to ease the
maintenance of sphinx-based documentation and avoid systematically copying the
associated python module maintained within the CMake repository.

Later in early August 2021, [henryiii][henryiii] discovered the
`sphinx-moderncmakedomain` project while working on scikit-build issue
[#574][skbuild-issue-574] intended to simplify its documentation generation
infrastructure and avoid updating its own copy of the sphinx extension.
[henryiii][henryiii] and [jcfr][jcfr] then worked with
[slurps-mad-rips][slurps-mad-rips] to establish a transition plan to
collaboratively maintain the project within the scikit-build organization.
