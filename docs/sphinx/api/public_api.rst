Public API
==========

Our API is semantically conforming; hence, the reader is highly encouraged to refer to the
corresponding facility in the `C++ Standard <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header>`_ if
needed. All names below are also available in the top-level ``einsums`` namespace unless
otherwise noted. The names in ``einsums`` should be preferred. The names in
sub-namespaces will eventually be removed.
