==============
v0.6.0 Release
==============

What's New
----------

* Element operations on GPU tensors
* Macro-based exception system
* True dot product for complex tensors. This does :math:`\mathbf{u}^*\mathbf{v}`, while the normal
  dot product does :math:`\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{v}`, with the difference being that the first vector
  is conjugated.
* Added in-line tensor arithmetic
* Permutations for block and tiled tensors
* Function tensors

Bug Fixes
---------

* Miscellaneous block tensor fixes
* GPU synchronization fixes
* GPU linear algebra fixes
