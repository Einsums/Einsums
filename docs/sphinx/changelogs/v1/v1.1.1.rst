==============
v1.1.1 Release
==============

What's New
----------
* Batching over collections of tensors has been added to Python.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a consistent issue where the launch parameters in almost all GPU kernels were swapped. The correct order should be
  :code:`<<<grid_specification, block_specification [, managed memory [, stream]]>>>`.
* Fixed a race condition in most of the GPU linear algebra functions.
* Removed assertions in the device tensor headers and replaced them with if statements.
* Fixed a bug in the Python in-core dot product contraction where the :code:`AB_prefactor` was not actually used.
