Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a typo in :cpp:func:`arange`. It was throwing an error when valid inputs were passed.
* Fixed a synchronization issue in the GPU tensor contractions
* Fixed a bug in the in-place tensor-scalar operations for :cpp:class:`Tensor`
* Fixed a typo in :cpp:func:`truncated_svd` that could cause compilation errors
* Fixed the :cpp:func:`hip_catch` family of functions so they would not construct temporary strings for every call.
  They now only construct temporary strings on failure.
