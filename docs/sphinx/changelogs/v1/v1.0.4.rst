==============
v1.0.4 Release
==============

What's New
----------

* :cpp:class:`Indices` no longer accepts things that aren't indices as arguments. This means that a tensor that
  shadows an index name will throw a more reasonable error, rather than the esoteric mess that it had
  in the past.

Bug Fixes
---------

* GPU tensor contractions now compile properly.
* :cpp:class:`BlockTensor`s with a block of zero size will no longer cause segfaults with an `einsum` call.
