==============
v2.0.0 Release
==============

What's New
----------
* Tensors are now stored in column-major ordering by default.
    * The ordering of the tensors can be selected by the users.
* Tensors are now based on a common implementation class to reduce the amount of code that needs to be maintained.
* The QR decomposition routine now outputs the Q and R matrices, rather than the intermediates needed to compute these.

What's Removed
--------------
* The `q` function from the C++ and Python interfaces, and the `r` function from the Python interface.
