Overview
========

|einsums| is organized into different sub-libraries and those in turn into modules.
The libraries and modules are independent, with clear dependencies and no
cycles. As an end-user, the use of these libraries is completely transparent. If
you use e.g. ``add_einsums_executable`` to create a target in your project you will
automatically get all modules as dependencies. See below for a list of the
available libraries and modules. Currently these are nothing more than an
internal grouping and do not affect usage. They cannot be consumed individually
at the moment.
