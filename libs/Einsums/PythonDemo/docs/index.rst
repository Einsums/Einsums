PythonDemo

``PythonDemo`` is a small set of header-only examples that exercise the
:ref:`Python <modules_Einsums_Python>` binding generator end-to-end. The
module is built and bound whenever ``EINSUMS_BUILD_PYTHON=ON`` and serves
two purposes:

- A reference for contributors wanting to see what annotations the codegen
  expects in order to produce a working Python surface.
- A smoke-test for the codegen itself. If the demo headers stop binding
  cleanly, the codegen tool ``einsums-pybind`` has regressed.

Contents
========

- ``Counter.hpp``: a trivial class with bound methods, demonstrating
  the standard codegen path for a stateful object.
- ``Coverage.hpp``: a broader spread of overloads, default arguments,
  and template instantiation annotations. It exercises the harder parts
  of the binding generator, namely the dtype dispatcher, the ``.pyi``
  emitter, and return-by-tuple handling.

The bound Python surface lives in ``einsums.demo``.

See the :ref:`API reference <modules_Einsums_PythonDemo_api>` of this
module for the exposed C++ surface.
