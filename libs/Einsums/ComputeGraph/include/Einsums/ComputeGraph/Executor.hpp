/**
 * @file Executor.hpp
 * @brief Pluggable execution backends for computation graphs.
 *
 * The Executor abstraction decouples the graph structure from the execution
 * strategy. Built-in executors:
 * - **SequentialExecutor**: Executes nodes in topological order (default)
 * - **OpenMPExecutor**: Launches independent nodes as OpenMP tasks
 *
 * Future executors: CudaStreamExecutor, CoroutineExecutor.
 *
 * @par Example
 * @code
 * cg::OpenMPExecutor omp_exec;
 * graph.execute(omp_exec);           // Parallel execution
 * graph.execute();                   // Sequential (default)
 * pipeline.execute(omp_exec);       // Pipeline with parallel stages
 * @endcode
