/**
 * @brief A directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tensor operations.
 *
 * The Graph class is the central container for the computation graph. It stores
 * a sequence of operation nodes and the tensor handles they reference. Key features:
 *
 * - **Capture**: Operations are added during a capture phase (via CaptureGuard).
 * - **Topological sorting**: Nodes are sorted based on data dependencies before execution.
 * - **Execution**: All nodes execute in dependency order. Calling execute() multiple
 *   times replays the same operations (useful for iterative algorithms).
 * - **Optimization**: Passes can be applied to fuse, eliminate, or reorder nodes.
 * - **Tensor ownership**: Intermediate tensors can be created via create_tensor()
 *   so the graph manages their lifetimes.
 * - **Validation**: Before execution, tensor pointers are checked for use-after-free.
 * - **Profiling**: execute() wraps each node in profiler regions with annotations.
 * - **Visualization**: print_dot() exports GraphViz format; print_summary() prints text.
 *
