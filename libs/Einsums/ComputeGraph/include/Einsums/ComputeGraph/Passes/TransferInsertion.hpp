/**
 * @brief Insert HostToDevice and DeviceToHost transfer nodes around GPU-placed operations.
 *
 * For each GPU-targeted node:
 * - For each input tensor: if not already on the device, insert an HostToDevice node.
 *   Skips H2D for "dead" inputs (e.g., C in `C = A*B` when c_prefactor == 0).
 * - For each output tensor: if a later CPU node reads it, insert a DeviceToHost node.
 *
 * After the main loop, inserts final D2H nodes for any user-visible (non-intermediate)
 * tensor that is still Device-resident. This makes the graph self-contained: on
 * discrete GPUs (CUDA/HIP), explicit D2H ensures results are available to the user
 * after execute() without relying on an implicit flush. On unified memory (MPS),
 * these D2H nodes exist in the graph structure but execution skips the actual copy.
 *
 * Tensor residency in TensorHandle is updated as transfers are inserted:
 * - After HostToDevice: residency = Both
 * - After DeviceToHost: residency = Both
 * - GPU node outputs: residency = Device
 *
 * This pass must run AFTER GPUPlacement.
 * Redundant transfers are removed by TransferElimination.
