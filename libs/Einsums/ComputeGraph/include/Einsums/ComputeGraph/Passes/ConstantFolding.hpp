/**
 * @brief Constant folding pass.
 *
 * Identifies nodes whose inputs are all "constant", meaning no other node
 * in the graph writes to those tensors. These nodes can be executed once
 * during the pass and replaced with no-ops, since their results won't
 * change across graph replays.
 *
 * Only graph-owned intermediate tensors (created via `create_tensor()`) that
 * are never written by any node are treated as initially constant. User-owned
 * tensors are NOT assumed constant because they may change between loop
 * iterations or between successive `execute()` calls. This makes the pass
 * safe for both one-shot graphs and loop bodies.
 *
 * This is especially useful for setup operations that build transformation
 * matrices, orthogonalization matrices, etc. from fixed input data.
 *
 * @par Example
 * @code
 * // If A and B are never written by any node in the graph:
 * cg::einsum("ij <- ik ; kj", &C, A, B);  // Constant! Fold it.
 * cg::scale(2.0, &C);                      // C is written above, so this depends on it
 *                                           // But after folding, C is constant too.
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note The pass executes folded nodes during the pass itself (not during
 *       graph.execute()). This means the pass has side effects on tensor data.
