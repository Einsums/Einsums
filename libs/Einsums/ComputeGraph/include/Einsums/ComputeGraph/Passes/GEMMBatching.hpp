/**
 * @brief Collapse groups of independent GEMMs into a single
 * `blas::gemm_batch` call.
 *
 * Groups Einsum nodes that match all of:
 *   - Same dependency level (no data dependencies between members).
 *   - 2D×2D→2D contraction shape with exactly one link index (the
 *     `gemm_hint` populated at capture time).
 *   - Identical `m`, `n`, `k`, `trans_a`, `trans_b`, element type
 *     (@ref BlasScalar), and `alpha`/`beta` prefactors.
 *
 * Each such group is replaced with a single @ref OpKind::BatchedGemm
 * node whose executor extracts data pointers + leading dimensions
 * from all members at call time, packs them into pointer arrays, and
 * dispatches the type-appropriate `blas::gemm_batch<T>`. The batched
 * node's `inputs` vector holds 2N tensor ids (A_0, B_0, A_1, B_1, …);
 * its `outputs` holds N tensor ids (C_0, C_1, …).
 *
 * @note Today, `blas::gemm_batch` is an OpenMP-parallel loop over
 * per-matrix `dgemm` calls (see BLASVendor/src/gemm_batch.cpp). The
 * primary speedup from this pass therefore comes from batch-level
 * parallelism, not vendor-native batched dispatch. When a vendor
 * override (e.g. MKL's `cblas_dgemm_batch`) is wired in, this pass
 * picks up the additional benefit without any code change here.
 *
 * @par Leading-dimension handling:
 * `blas::gemm_batch` takes a single scalar `lda`/`ldb`/`ldc` shared
 * across the batch, different per-matrix strides can't be batched.
 * Verifies uniformity at pass time using the hint's extractors on the
 * current tensor state; if strides differ across the group, the pass
 * falls through without rewriting (a future optimisation could split
 * the group into stride-compatible sub-batches).
