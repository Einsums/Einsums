     *
     *  1. ConstantFolding: evaluate constant-input nodes at compile time
     *  2. ScaleAbsorption: fold Scale(α) into the next op's beta
     *  3. PermuteFusion: absorb leading permutes into the GEMM trans flags
     *  4. CSE: common subexpression elimination
     *  5. DeadNodeElimination: drop nodes whose outputs are unused
     *  6. ElementWiseFusion: merge adjacent element-wise ops
     *  7. LoopInvariantHoisting: move invariant ops out of Loop bodies
     *  8. GEMMBatching: collapse compatible GEMMs into one BatchedGemm
     *  9. Reorder: memory-aware topological sort
     * 10. IOPrefetch: overlap DiskRead with compute
     * 11. DistributionPlanning: classify indices for distributed dispatch
     * 12. Materialization: resize deferred tensors to local partitions
     * 13. SymmetryPropagation: infer symmetry on graph intermediates and
     *                                 push to backing tensors for rank-2 BLAS dispatch
     *
     * GPU block (when a GPU backend or mock is available):
     * 14. GPUPlacement: cost-model based node-to-GPU assignment
     * 15. TransferInsertion: insert HostToDevice / DeviceToHost nodes
     * 16. TransferElimination: drop redundant transfers
     * 17. GPUDiagnostics: log placement decisions
     * 18. StreamAssignment: assign CUDA/HIP streams for overlap
     *
     * Distributed block (when MPI or its mock is available):
     * 19. InputSlicing: create per-rank views of distributed inputs
     * 20. SUMMAExpansion: expand einsums to SUMMA loops on square grids
     * 21. CommunicationInsertion: insert allreduces for replicated outputs
     * 22. CommunicationElimination: drop redundant communications
     * 23. CommunicationScheduling: split allreduce into async iallreduce + wait
     *
     * Tail (always registered):
     * 24. FreeInsertion: free intermediates after last consumer
     * 25. MemoryPlanning: analysis: tensor liveness + peak memory
     * 26. ContractionPlanning: analysis: per-einsum dispatch choice
     * 27. InplaceOptimization: analysis: detect in-place candidates
