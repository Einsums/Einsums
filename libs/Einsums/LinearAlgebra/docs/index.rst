==============

This module contains the user-facing definitions of various linear algebra routines.

See the :ref:`API reference <modules_Einsums_LinearAlgebra_api>` of this module for more
details.

Public API
----------

Here are some of the public symbols that are available to use. More can be found in the :ref:`API reference <modules_Einsums_LinearAlgebra_api>`.

.. cpp:function:: template<TensorConcept AType> void sum_square(const AType &A, RemoveComplexT<typename AType::ValueType> *scale, RemoveComplexT<typename AType::ValueType> *sumsq)

    Computes the sum of the squares of the elements of a tensor. This uses the following formula.

    .. math::

        scale_{out}^2 * sum_{out} = A_1^2 + A_2^2 + \cdots + A_n^2 + scale_{in}^2 * sum_{in}

    On exit, the value of :code:`scale` will normally be 1. However, it may be different if the 
    result of the sum would have caused either an overflow or an underflow.

    Currently only supports :code:`BasicTensor`s of rank 1.

    :param A[in]: The tensor to evaluate.
    :param scale[inout]: The scale factor. It is both an input and output parameter.
    :param sumsq[inout]: The starting point and result. It is both an input and output parameter.

    :code:`A` needs to be rank 2 and :code:`W` needs to be rank 1.

    * BasicTensor to BasicTensor
    * BlockTensor to BasicTensor

    :param A: On entry, it is the matrix to decompose. On exit, it contains the eigenvectors in its columns, if told to compute the eigenvectors.

.. cpp:function:: template <MatrixConcept AType, VectorConcept WType> void geev(AType *A, WType *W, AType *lvecs, AType *rvecs)

    Compute the eingendecomposition of a general matrix. If a real matrix has a complex eigenvalue, it will
    always come in a conjugate pair. In this case, the columns of the eigenvector matrix will 
    act as the real and imaginary parts. The first column of the two will be the real part,
    and the second column will be the imaginary part of the first eigenvector. The imaginary
    part of the second eigenvector will be the negative of this vector. This only applies to
    real inputs. If the input is complex, then the eigenvectors will be stored as normal.

    Supports the following:

    :code:`AType` needs to be rank2 and :code:`W` needs to be rank 1.

    :code:`W` needs to store complex values. :code:`A` can be real or complex. The stored
    types much match in precision, so :code:`std::complex<float>` will match either :code:`float`
    or :code:`std::complex<float>`.

    :tparam WType: The type of the value output.

    ::throws rank_error: If the inputs have the wrong ranks. The A tensor needs to be rank-2 and the W tensor needs to be rank-1.
    :throws dimension_error: If the matrix input is not square.

    .. versionadded:: 1.0.0

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0.0
        The option to compute eigenvectors is no longer a template argument. It is now decided by whether the appropriate parameter is
        a null pointer or not. For instance, if :code:`lvecs` is a null pointer then it will not be computed.

    Solves a system of linear equations.

    :param A[inout[]]: The coefficient matrix. On exit, it contains the upper and lower triangular factors, even if the return value is greater than zero. The
    elements of the lower triangular factor are all 1, so they are not stored.
    :param B[inout]: The constant matrix. If this function returns 0, then on exit, this will contain the solutions.
    :return: If the return value is greater than 0, then the input matrix is singular. If it is less than zero,
    then the input contains an invalid value, such as infinity. If it is zero, then the system could be solved.

    :throws rank_error: If the coefficient matrix is not rank-2 or the result matrix is not rank-1 or rank-2.
    :throws dimension_error: If the coefficient matrix is not square, or the number of rows of the result matrix is not the same as the number
