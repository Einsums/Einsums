"""Python package shell for einsums.

Importing ``einsums``, or any subpackage like ``einsums.rc``, loads the
compiled extension ``einsums._core`` so that its bindings, both types and
functions, are registered immediately. This is what lets an external module
that merely receives an einsums object, such as psi4 returning a
``TiledRuntimeTensor``, work after a plain ``import einsums``, with no need
to ``import einsums._core`` explicitly.

Loading ``_core`` only registers the bindings; it does NOT start the C++
runtime. Runtime startup through ``einsums::initialize`` is deferred to the
first real use via :func:`_ensure_initialized`, so ``einsums.rc`` can still be
configured first and is read at init time.

Typical usage::

    import einsums.rc
    einsums.rc.threads = 8         # optional pre-init config

    import einsums
    einsums.gemm(...)              # runtime initializes here, using rc

``import einsums.rc`` is optional. ``einsums.rc`` is always present with
default ``None`` values, and the runtime initializes from those defaults
on first use if nothing was configured.
