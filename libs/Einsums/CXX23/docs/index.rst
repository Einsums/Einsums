.. _modules_Einsums_CXX23:

#####
CXX23
#####

The ``CXX23`` module is a small collection of C++23 polyfills for compilers
or standard library versions where a feature isn't yet available.

Einsums targets the C++23 baseline, but some toolchains lag on individual
library features. Examples include older libstdc++, Apple libc++ on certain
SDK levels, and Intel oneAPI. ``CXX23`` provides drop-in replacements behind
feature-test-macro guards so the rest of the codebase can use the C++23
spelling unconditionally.

What's polyfilled
=================

The headers in this module follow a uniform pattern: include the standard
header if the feature-test macro indicates the feature is present;
otherwise expose a compatible implementation in the ``einsums::cxx23``
namespace.

Currently provided:

- ``Einsums/CXX23/Expected.hpp`` provides the ``std::expected<T, E>``
  polyfill, guarded on ``__cpp_lib_expected``. Include it as the very
  first standard header so the macro is set consistently across
  translation units. If some TUs see the polyfill and others do not, the
  mismatch causes ODR violations at link time.

Usage
=====

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <Einsums/CXX23/Expected.hpp>

    using einsums::cxx23::expected;
    using einsums::cxx23::unexpected;

    expected<int, std::string> parse(std::string_view s) {
        if (s.empty()) {
            return unexpected("empty input");
        }
        return std::stoi(std::string{s});
    }

When toolchain support catches up, the polyfill becomes a no-op
``using std::expected;`` alias and existing call sites need no change.

See the :ref:`API reference <modules_Einsums_CXX23_api>` of this module for
the polyfill surface.
