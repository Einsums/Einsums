## Project Overview

Einsums is a C++20 tensor algebra library that uses compile-time contraction pattern analysis to select optimal operations: BLAS calls, a packed-GEMM backend, or generic algorithms. It uses a modular CMake build system with an optional CUDA or HIP GPU backend. A few components rely on C++23 features through the CXX23 compatibility module, which supplies C++20 fallbacks.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Configure (from build directory, out-of-source required)
cmake -S . -B build -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

# With MPI distributed computing (requires Open MPI or MPICH), experimental
cmake -S . -B build -GNinja -DEINSUMS_WITH_MPI=ON

# Build everything
cmake --build build

# Build a specific test target
cmake --build build --target Einsum1_test

# Run all tests
ctest --test-dir build

# Run a single test (Catch2-based, uses ctest discovery)
ctest --test-dir build -R "Einsum1"

# Run a specific Catch2 test case directly
./build/libs/Einsums/TensorAlgebra/tests/unit/Einsum1_test "[test-case-name]"

# Build a specific module's tests
cmake --build build --target Tests.Unit.Modules.TensorAlgebra
```

### Conda Development Environment

The conda environment file is generated rather than checked in. `devtools/conda-envs/conda.yml` is gitignored, so you create it with `merge_yml.py`, which merges the per-OS, per-compiler, and per-BLAS snippets under `devtools/conda-envs/snippets/`:

```bash
cd devtools/conda-envs
python merge_yml.py            # platform defaults: gcc on Linux or clang on macOS, with openblas or accelerate
# To choose a toolchain and BLAS, or add documentation dependencies:
#   python merge_yml.py clang openblas --docs
conda env create -f conda.yml
conda activate einsums-dev
```

When looking for header files outside of Einsums, look inside the `einsums-dev` conda environment.

## Code Formatting

Pre-commit hooks enforce formatting. Install with `pre-commit install`.

- **C++**: clang-format v16 with LLVM-based style, 4-space indent, 140-column limit (`.clang-format`)
- **CMake**: cmake-format v0.6.10 (`.cmake-format.py`)
- **License headers**: Auto-inserted in `.cpp`, `.hpp`, `.cmake`, `.py` files

## Architecture

### Module System

All modules live under `libs/Einsums/<ModuleName>/` with the standard layout:
```
libs/Einsums/<Name>/
  CMakeLists.txt              # calls einsums_add_module()
  include/Einsums/<Name>/     # public headers
  src/                        # implementation files
  tests/unit/                 # unit tests
  tests/performance/          # benchmarks
```

Module registration uses `einsums_add_module(Einsums <Name> SOURCES ... HEADERS ... MODULE_DEPENDENCIES ...)` in CMake. The module list lives in `libs/Einsums/CMakeLists.txt`. New modules are created with the `create_module_skeleton` Python package in `libs/`, run from that directory as `python3 create_module_skeleton LIBRARY_NAME MODULE_NAME`.

### Key Module Dependency Chain

`TensorAlgebra` -> `LinearAlgebra` -> `BLAS` -> `BLASBase` and `BLASVendor`

`BLAS` depends on both `BLASBase` and `BLASVendor`. `TensorAlgebra` is the eager entry point. Its `einsum()` function dispatches through `Backends/Dispatch.hpp`, which selects in order: BLAS specializations, the packed-GEMM backend (`try_packed_gemm`), then a generic algorithm.

### ComputeGraph

`ComputeGraph` (`libs/Einsums/ComputeGraph/`) is the preferred way to use Einsums for real workloads. It records a sequence of operations as a graph, optimizes that graph with built-in passes such as common subexpression elimination, fusion, and memory planning, and then executes or replays it. Prefer it for anything beyond a quick experiment, and especially for iterative algorithms such as SCF or coupled cluster, where the same operations run many times and the graph is built once and replayed. Every graph-aware operation lives in the `einsums::compute_graph` namespace and mirrors the signature of its eager counterpart, so moving eager code onto a graph is mostly mechanical. The eager `einsum()` and `linear_algebra` calls remain a convenient way to script quick one-off computations. See `libs/Einsums/ComputeGraph/docs/getting_started.rst` for a walkthrough.

### Tensor Types

- `Tensor<T, Rank>` - dense tensor, column-major. The `EINSUMS_ROW_MAJOR_DEFAULT` CMake option existed historically but never controlled the stride initializer, so tensors are always column-major at construction.
- `TensorView<T, Rank>` - non-owning view into a tensor
- `BlockTensor`, `TiledTensor` - structured variants
- `T.data()` for raw pointer, `T.dim(i)` for size, `T.stride(i)` for stride

### Index System

Indices are compile-time structs created with `MAKE_INDEX(x)` -> struct with `static constexpr const char *letter = "x"`. Index letters drive compile-time contraction analysis.

### Test System

Tests use Catch2 v3. CMake helpers:
```cmake
# Create test executable (not installed)
einsums_add_executable(MyTest_test INTERNAL_FLAGS SOURCES MyTest.cpp NOINSTALL)

# Register as unit test (creates ctest entry under Tests.Unit.Modules.<Module>.MyTest)
einsums_add_unit_test("Modules.ModuleName" MyTest)

# Performance test
einsums_add_performance_test("Modules.ModuleName" MyTest)
```

### CMake Options

Key options (`-D<option>=ON/OFF`):
- `EINSUMS_WITH_TESTS` / `EINSUMS_WITH_TESTS_UNIT` / `EINSUMS_WITH_TESTS_BENCHMARKS` - test categories
- `EINSUMS_WITH_MPI` - MPI distributed computing (Comm module, ProcessGrid, distributed passes)
- `EINSUMS_WITH_CUDA` / `EINSUMS_WITH_HIP` - GPU backends
- `EINSUMS_BUILD_PYTHON` - Python bindings via pybind11
- `EINSUMS_WITH_PROFILER` - built-in profiling support

### Config Defines

Build options map to preprocessor defines: `EINSUMS_WITH_FOO=ON` -> `einsums_add_config_define(EINSUMS_HAVE_FOO)` -> `#if defined(EINSUMS_HAVE_FOO)` in code. The generated config header is `<Einsums/Config.hpp>`.

### External Dependencies

Each dependency has a `cmake/Einsums_Setup<Dep>.cmake` file included from the root CMakeLists.txt. Required: BLAS/LAPACK, HDF5, OpenMP. Auto-fetched if missing: fmt, Catch2, spdlog. Optional: MPI (Open MPI or MPICH).

### Distributed Computing (MPI, experimental)

Einsums has early, incomplete MPI support gated behind `EINSUMS_WITH_MPI`. The `Comm` module (`libs/Einsums/Comm/`) provides a 2D process grid, distribution descriptors, and collectives, with a mock backend so serial builds still compile, and ComputeGraph has passes that can distribute an einsum across ranks. This area is under active development and not yet production-ready, so treat the distributed APIs as unstable.

When you do build tests, note that `einsums_add_executable` already links `libEinsums`. Do not add extra `target_link_libraries` for Einsums modules in test CMakeLists, since that causes duplicate-symbol issues with MPI.
